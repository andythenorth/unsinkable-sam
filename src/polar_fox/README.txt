This project provides a package of common assets which are used in vehicle newgrfs by andythenorth.

*Examples*

- cargos for inclusion in cargo table
- refits by label for different classes of vehicle
- sprites for cargo graphics
- graphics constants
- pixa graphics processing module

Extend as needed.

Docs are in compiled into `docs` and possibly also at https://grf.farm/polar_fox/index.html

*Usage*

There is a single script that will assemble the distributed files and copy them to consumers.  This assumes a specific filesystem layout and is not intended to be portable.

*Caveats*

1. This might all be a terrible idea.
2. See 1.
